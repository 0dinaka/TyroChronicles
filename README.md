# TyroChronicles
Turning numbers in narratives- this portfolio displays my data analysis journey as a beginner. Here I uncover patterns, tell stories with data, and build solutions that matter. From cleaning messy datasets to crafting compelling visualizations. Each project reflects my journey, reminding me where I started and encouraging me not to relent.
